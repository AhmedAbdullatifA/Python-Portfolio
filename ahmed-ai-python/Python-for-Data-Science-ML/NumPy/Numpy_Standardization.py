# This project demonstrates how to perform feature standardization
# on a dataset using NumPy only, without using any explicit loops.

# Each column represents a feature and is normalized using the
# standard score (z-score) formula:

#     X_norm = (X - mean) / std

# The implementation relies on NumPy vectorization and broadcasting
# for efficient computation, which is a common preprocessing step
# in machine learning pipelines.
