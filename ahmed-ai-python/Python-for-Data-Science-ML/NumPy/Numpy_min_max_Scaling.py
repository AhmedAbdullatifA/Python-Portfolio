# This project implements Min-Max feature scaling from scratch using NumPy only.

# Each column in the dataset represents a feature, and each row represents a data sample.
# The goal is to scale all features to a range between 0 and 1 using the Min-Max
# normalization formula:

#     X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)

# The implementation avoids explicit loops and relies entirely on NumPy vectorization
# and broadcasting for efficient computation.

# Special care is taken to handle edge cases where a feature has no variance
# (i.e., X_max == X_min). In such cases, the entire feature column is set to zero
# to prevent division by zero and ensure numerical stability.

# This preprocessing step is commonly used in machine learning pipelines and mirrors
# the behavior of standard libraries such as scikit-learn.
